### A small microservice project related to a shopping service website

Achieve the basic function of:
1. Product Service: create and view products
2. Order Service: users can order products
3. Inventory Service: check if product is in stock or nor
4. Notification Service: send notifications to users after the order is placed





This is my first Java project and I hope to explore more about SpringBoot and database through this project.

Moreover, I hope this learning experience will facilitate my future microservice project.

Technologies: SpringBoot, MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka, Resilience4J. Vault

I learn through this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPPhcU7oWDU&t=2335s
